What are the new consoles?<br>
As mentioned, there are two new consoles coming out later this year, likely in the holiday period.

Xbox Series X
When people throw bias to the side, the upcoming Xbox is edging out as the favourite option. Many people have picked up on the aesthetic being styled after a traditional PC, but as more details come out, it’s clear the Xbox Series X will essentially be a low-mid tier PC.

Whilst it’s still early days on getting full details on the console, the core of details has come to light, with the major news being that it will have 12 teraflops of graphical power. This is a serious upgrade and something Sony have struggled to keep up with.

<!--PlayStation 5
In comparison to Microsoft, Sony have held their cards close to their chest regarding specs, designs and the release date. There have been leaks from a Sony-registered patents, which shows off what we can expect the shape to be, the buttons and how it will be cooled.

Early leaks and rumours have suggested that the PS5 will max out at 9.2 teraflops of graphical power, a considerable amount lower than that of the new Xbox.-->
